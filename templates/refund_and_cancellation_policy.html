                <p>You can contact us via:</p>

                </ul>
                <p>The deadline for cancellation is 7 days from the date you, or a third party you appoint (who is not the carrier), take possession of the delivered product.</p>

                <h5>Returns and Refunds</h5>
                <p>For goods to be eligible for a return, you need to ensure that the goods were purchased within the last 7 days and are in their original packaging.</p>
                <p>However, certain goods cannot be returned:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Goods made to your specifications or that are clearly personalized.</li>
                    <li>Goods that are not suitable for return due to their nature, deteriorate rapidly, or are past their expiry date.</li>
                    <li>Goods that were unsealed after delivery and are not suitable for return for health protection or hygiene reasons.</li>
                    <li>Goods that have been inseparably mixed with other items after delivery.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You are responsible for the cost and risk of returning the goods. You should send the goods to the following address:</p>
                <p>Microwhite,<br>[Your Address Here]</p>

                <h5>Reimbursement</h5>
                <p>We will reimburse you no later than 14 days from the day we receive the returned goods. The reimbursement will be made using the same payment method you used for the order, and you will not incur any fees for this.</p>

                <h5>Damaged or Wrong Items</h5>
                <p>Customer returns are accepted only when a wrong or damaged product is delivered. In such cases, you should contact our support team via email within 4 days of delivery.</p>
                <p>We reserve the right to cancel orders if we suspect fraud, incorrect information, or policy violations. In such instances, customers will be notified, and refunds will be processed where applicable.</p>
